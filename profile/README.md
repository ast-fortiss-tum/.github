# Welcome to the Automated Software Testing (AST) group at fortiss/TUM! 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

🧙 The organization contains the GitHub repositories with the research carried out at the Automated Software Testing (AST) Field of Competence at fortiss and the Chair of Software Engineering for Data-intensive Applications of the School of Computation, Information and Technology of the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
You will find the algorithms and tools we developed in our research papers. 


👩‍💻 Current projects involve test generation, monitoring techniques, automated functional oracles, and domain transferability for deep learning-based systems, with a particular focus on autonomous vehicles, as well as the robustness and maintainability of test suites of modern web applications.


👨‍👨‍👧‍👧 Our research focuses on the interface between software engineering and deep learning with the goal of improving the robustness, reliability, and dependability of data-intensive software systems.
